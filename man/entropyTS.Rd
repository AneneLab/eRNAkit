\title{Compute Tissue/Cell Type Specificity Scores}
\usage{
entropyTS(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or matrix where rows represent eRNAs and columns
represent different tissues or cell types. Only numeric columns
(expression values) are used for calculations.}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
\describe{
  \item{ID}{The identifier (row names of input data).}
  \item{Specificity_Score}{The calculated specificity score for each row.}
  \item{Is_Specific}{The tissue/cell type where the transcript is specific, or FALSE if not specific.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates specificity scores for eRNA or genes based on their
expression profiles across multiple tissues or cell types. The specificity
score is computed using Shannon entropy and a logarithmic correction.
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Compute expression ratios by normalizing each eRNA's expression across tissues/cell types.
  \item Calculate Shannon entropy for each eRNA.
  \item Compute the specificity score as \eqn{log_2(N) - H}, where \(N\) is the number of cell types
        and \(H\) is Shannon entropy.
  \item Define specificity by checking if the highest expression ratio is at least 2Ã— the second highest
        and if the specificity score is greater than 1.
